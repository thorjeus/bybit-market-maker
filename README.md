# bybit-market-maker
A very primitive Python-based market maker bot for Bybit, meant to be used a sample. Users can fork this repository and customize their own algorithms. Uses the [`pybit`](https://github.com/verata-veritatis/pybit) module.

## Usage
Be sure you have [`pybit`](https://github.com/verata-veritatis/pybit) installed:
```
pip install pybit
```
Next, clone or download this repository and extract. Modify `settings.py` to your liking, navigate to the project via CLI, and `python run.py`.

## How It Works
- A given number of long and short orders are spaced evenly from the current last price up to a user-defined range. The last price at the time of placement is considered the *median*. 
- If a single side of orders begins to fill, the bot waits for the price to return to the *median* and will cancel the rest of the unfilled orders.
- Close orders are submitted and a conditional stop loss is set at near-breakeven.
- This strategy has little-to-no risk management. If all orders on a given side fill and the price continues in that direction, there is a liqiudation risk.

## Disclaimer
*This project is still in the early stages of development. Please refrain from using the bot on livenet until it is stable!*
